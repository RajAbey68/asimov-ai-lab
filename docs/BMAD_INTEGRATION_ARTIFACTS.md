## Core BMAD Artifacts for Asimov-AI Delivery

### 1. Agentic Planning Framework

**What It Is**: Dedicated AI planning agents (Analyst, Project Manager, Architect) that collaborate to generate structured requirements and architecture.

**Deliverables**:
- Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) with business context
- Architecture diagrams and specifications
- UX guidance and domain insights
- Risk identification and technical constraints

**Integration with Asimov-AI**:
- **Observe Phase**: BMAD Analyst agent gathers system inventory and stakeholder context
- **Orient Phase**: BMAD Architect maps technical landscape against governance requirements
- **Decide Phase**: Joint decisions integrate governance controls with technical architecture
- **Sprint Phase**: Context-engineered stories include governance checkpoints

**Why It Matters**: Eliminates the gap between governance requirements and technical implementation. Every technical decision includes embedded governance context.

---

### 2. Context-Engineered Development (Story Files)

**What It Is**: Structured story files generated by the Scrum Master agent that include full architectural context, implementation guidelines, and embedded reasoning.

**Each Story File Contains**:
- Full architectural context (APIs, data models, dependencies)
- Implementation guidelines with governance constraints
- Embedded reasoning: What, why, and how to build it
- Testing criteria including compliance validation
- Risk mitigation steps

**Integration with Asimov-AI**:
- Stories include governance control references (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001)
- Each story maps to audit requirements and evidence needs
- Quality gates include compliance checks alongside functional tests
- Retrospective reviews capture governance lessons learned

**Why It Matters**: Zero context loss. Every developer and auditor has the same information. No guessing about compliance requirements during implementation.

---

### 3. Scale Adaptive Framework

**What It Is**: BMAD v6's architecture fluidly scales from solo prototypes to team and enterprise deployments without rewriting the approach.

**Scaling Dimensions**:
- **Solo**: Single developer with AI agents for rapid prototyping
- **Team**: 2-10 people with distributed agent workflows
- **Enterprise**: Multiple teams, shared governance policies, centralized audit trails

**Integration with Asimov-AI**:
- **Solo**: Governance-by-design templates and checklists
- **Team**: Shared risk registers and compliance dashboards
- **Enterprise**: Board-level reporting, audit coordination, multi-stakeholder governance

**Why It Matters**: As AI systems mature from prototype to production, governance scales seamlessly alongside development practices.

---

### 4. Phase-Based Development Workflow

**What It Is**: BMAD organizes work into four structured phases that mirror agile sprints with governance integration points.

**Phase Structure**:

#### Phase 1: Discovery (Observe)
- **BMAD Artifacts**: Business context, stakeholder interviews, domain research
- **Asimov-AI Layer**: AI system inventory, risk classification, regulatory landscape
- **Joint Deliverable**: Integrated discovery document with technical and governance context

#### Phase 2: Planning (Orient)
- **BMAD Artifacts**: PRDs, user stories, feature prioritization
- **Asimov-AI Layer**: Risk mapping, compliance requirements, control selection
- **Joint Deliverable**: Planning documentation with embedded risk mitigation

#### Phase 3: Solutioning (Decide)
- **BMAD Artifacts**: Architecture diagrams, data flow models, API specifications
- **Asimov-AI Layer**: Governance controls, audit evidence plan, policy alignment
- **Joint Deliverable**: Architecture + governance blueprint

#### Phase 4: Implementation (Sprint)
- **BMAD Artifacts**: Story files, code reviews, test plans, sprint retrospectives
- **Asimov-AI Layer**: Compliance validation, evidence capture, continuous monitoring
- **Joint Deliverable**: Working software with audit trail

**Cycle Back**: After each sprint, return to Observe phase with lessons learned and updated risk profile.

### 5. Custom Agents & Workflows

**What It Is**: BMAD allows definition of domain-specific agents with precise roles, tools, and constraints.

**Available Agent Roles**:
- **Analyst**: Requirements gathering, domain research, business context
- **Project Manager**: Prioritization, stakeholder coordination, workflow orchestration
- **Architect**: System design, technical decisions, architecture documentation
- **UX Designer**: Interface design, wireframes, user journey mapping
- **Developer**: Implementation, code reviews, refactoring
- **QA/TEA**: Test planning, quality validation, bug tracking
- **Tech Writer**: Documentation, API guides, knowledge transfer
- **Scrum Master**: Story generation, sprint planning, retrospectives

**Asimov-AI Extensions** (New Agent Roles):
- **Governance Lead**: Risk assessment, policy mapping, compliance validation
- **Audit Coordinator**: Evidence collection, audit preparation, regulatory liaison
- **Ethics Reviewer**: Bias assessment, fairness evaluation, impact analysis
- **IP Strategist**: Intellectual property management, licensing, confidentiality controls

**Why It Matters**: BMAD's agent framework provides the scaffolding. Asimov-AI adds governance-specific agents to create a complete delivery ecosystem.

---

### 6. Reference Architectures & Project Types

**What It Is**: Proven blueprints for common application patterns and deployment targets.

**BMAD Reference Architectures**:
- Web applications (React, Vue, Angular)
- Mobile apps (React Native, Flutter)
- APIs and microservices
- Data pipelines and ML workflows
- Game development
- Creative/content generation systems

**Asimov-AI Governance Overlays**:
- **High-Risk AI Systems**: Architecture includes explainability layers, human oversight, audit logging
- **Regulated Industries**: Architecture embeds data governance, access controls, encryption
- **IP-Sensitive Projects**: Architecture includes provenance tracking, license management, attribution systems

**Deliverable**: Combined reference architectures that are both technically sound AND governance-ready.

---

### 7. Party Mode (Multi-Agent Collaboration)

**What It Is**: BMAD v6 feature enabling multiple AI agents to collaborate on complex tasks with orchestrated workflows.

**How It Works**:
- Define agent teams for specific workflows (e.g., "Planning Party" = Analyst + PM + Architect)
- Agents share context through structured handoffs
- Party mode manifests define roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols

**Integration with Asimov-AI**:
- **Governance Party**: Risk assessor + compliance checker + ethics reviewer collaborate on high-risk features
- **Audit Party**: Evidence collector + documentation reviewer + external auditor coordinate audit preparation
- **Architecture Party**: Technical architect + governance lead + IP strategist align on system design

**Why It Matters**: Complex governance challenges require multi-stakeholder input. Party mode provides the orchestration framework for collaborative governance decisions.

---

### 8. BMad Builder (Visual Configuration)

**What It Is**: Visual UI and CLI tools to assemble agents, workflows, and expansion packs without manual YAML editing.

**Capabilities**:
- Drag-and-drop agent team creation
- Workflow customization with visual flowcharts
- Expansion pack installation and configuration
