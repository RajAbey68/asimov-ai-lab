# Design Standards & Best Practices

This project adheres to the following core design principles and resources. All contributions should align with these standards.

## 1. Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g)
**Focus:** Foundational UX Research & Evidence-Based Guidelines  
**URL:** [nngroup.com](https://www.nngroup.com)

*   **Why:** The gold standard for UX research. Founded by Don Norman and Jakob Nielsen. Focuses on data-driven usability, not just trends.
*   **Key Application:**
    *   **Heuristics:** Adhere to the 10 Usability Heuristics.
    *   **Accessibility:** Ensure navigation and interaction patterns are inclusive.
    *   **Evidence-Based:** Justify UI placement (e.g., buttons, navigation) with research-backed data.

## 2. Google Material Design (Material 3)
**Focus:** Modern UI Design Systems & Component Standards  
**URL:** [m3.material.io](https://m3.material.io)

*   **Why:** Comprehensive, open-source framework for typography, color theory, motion, and interaction.
*   **Key Application:**
    *   **Design System:** Build a coherent system, not just isolated pages.
    *   **Accessibility:** Follow widely accepted accessibility standards for color contrast and touch targets.
    *   **Interaction:** clearly defined states (hover, active, disabled) and layouts.

## 3. Awwwards
**Focus:** Cutting-Edge Trends & Visual Innovation  
**URL:** [awwwards.com](https://www.awwwards.com)

*   **Why:** Represents the creative limit and "Site of the Day" quality. The "Oscars of Web Design."
*   **Key Application:**
    *   **Visual Excellence:** Aim for high-quality aesthetics that "wow" the user.
    *   **Modern Tech:** Incorporate trending technologies (WebGL, 3D, micro-animations) where appropriate.
    *   **Creativity:** Don't settle for "standard"—push for a unique, premium feel.
